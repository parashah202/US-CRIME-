# US-CRIME-
Analysis of the Homicide crimes in USA from 1980 to 2014 and Building an interactive Dashboard using Tableau for bringing out meaningful insights. 

This is my first project in Tableau and Visualization, with utter determination and proper guidance by tutor, I had been able to achieve 91% in the module. Being the topper in the class gives me further motivation.

For the accurate analysis, I have imported the census data of USA from 1980 to 2020 and carefully assigned that to each year with the propornate population growth.
Then the crime incidents had been compared with the census data to determine the area which is most active in crime.

For Presentation I have included Few slides explaining the meaning of homicides, and also some recommendations at the end.
